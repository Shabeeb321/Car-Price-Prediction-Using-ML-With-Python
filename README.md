# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning With Python

## Project Overview
This project implements a car price prediction model using two regression techniques: Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. The model predicts the selling price of cars based on various features such as fuel type, seller type, transmission, and other attributes. This project uses Python's pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries for data processing, visualization, and model training.
