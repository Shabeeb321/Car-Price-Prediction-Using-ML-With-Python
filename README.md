# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning With Python

## Project Overview
This project implements a car price prediction model using two regression techniques: Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. The model predicts the selling price of cars based on various features such as fuel type, seller type, transmission, and other attributes. This project uses Python's pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries for data processing, visualization, and model training.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle.com website containing car-related attributes such as:

1. Car_Name: Name of the car (dropped for modeling)
2. Year: Year of manufacture of the car
3. Selling_Price: Price at which the car is sold (target variable)
4. Present_Price: Current price of the car
5. Kms_Driven: Total kilometers driven by the car
6. Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
7. Seller_Type: Whether the seller is an individual or a dealer
8. Transmission: Transmission type (Manual or Automatic)
9. Owner: Number of previous owners of the car
  
The dataset is loaded from car data.csv and is cleaned and preprocessed for modeling.
